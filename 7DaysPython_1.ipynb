        "Python is a high-level programming language, commonly used for\n",
        "general purposes. It was originally developed by Guido van Rossum at the\n",
        "\"Center Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI), Netherlands”, in the 1980s and\n",
        "introduced by the “Python Software Foundation” in 1991. It was designed\n",
        "primarily to emphasize the readability of programming code, and its syntax\n",
        "enables programmers to convey ideas using fewer lines of code. Python\n",
        "programming language increases the speed of operation while allowing for\n",
        "higher efficiency in creating system integrations. Developers are using\n",
        "Python for “web development (server-side), software development,\n",
        "mathematics, system scripting”.\n",

        "With the introduction of various enhancements such as “list\n",
        "comprehension” and a “garbage collection system”, which can collect\n",
        "reference cycles, the Python 2.0 was launched in the last quarter of 2000.\n",
        "Subsequently, in 2008, Python 3.0 was released as a major version upgrade\n",
        "with backward compatibility allowing for the Python 2.0 code to be\n",
        "executed on Python 3.0 without requiring any modifications. Python is\n",
        "supported by a community of programmers that continually develop and\n",

        "language of choice for coding beginners as well as advanced software\n",
        "programmers alike:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.**Readability** : Python reads a lot like the\n",
        "English language, which contributes to its ease of readability.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.**Learnability** : Python is a high level programming\n",
        "language and considered easy to learn due to the ability to code\n",
        "using English language like expressions, which implies it is\n",
        "simple to comprehend and thereby learn the language.\n",

        "3.**Operating Systems** : Python is easily accessible and can\n",
        "be operated across different Operating systems, including\n",
        "Linux, Unix, Mac, Windows among others. This renders\n",
        "Python as a versatile and cross-platform language.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.**Open Source** : Python is \"open source”, which means\n",
        "that the developer community can seamlessly make updates to\n",
        "the code, which are always available to anyone using Python\n",
        "for their software programming needs.\n",
